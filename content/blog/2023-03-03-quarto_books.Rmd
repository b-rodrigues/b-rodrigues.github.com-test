I’ve been working on an ebook (that you can read over
[here](https://raps-with-r.dev/)) made using Quarto. Since I’m also selling a
DRM-free Epub and PDF on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/raps-with-r/) I wanted to
share some tips and tricks I’ve learned to generate an Epub that passes
`epubcheck` using Quarto.

Quarto is a tool made by Posit and is an *open-source scientific and technical*
publishing tool. If you know what LaTeX is, then it should be easy for you to
grok Quarto. The idea of Quarto is that you write documents using Markdown, and
then compile these source files into either PDFs, Word documents, but also
books, web-sites, ebooks (in the Epub format) and so on... It’s quite powerful,
and you can also use programming language code chunks for literate programming.
Quarto support R, Python, Julia and ObsevableJS chunks.

So, as I said, I’ve been using Quarto to write an ebook, and from a single set
of Markdown source files I can generate the website (linked above), the PDF of
the book and the Epub of the book. But you see, if you want to sell an Epub on
platforms like Leanpub, the generated Epub must pass `epubcheck`. `epubcheck` is
a command line application that verifies that your Epub satisfies certain
quality checks. If these quality standards are not satisfied, there is no
guarantee that Epub readers can successfully open your Epub. Leanpub actually
allows you to upload an Epub that does not pass `epubcheck`, but they warn you
that you really should strive for publishing an Epub without any errors or
warnings raised by `epubcheck`. For example, the first version of my Epub did not
pass `epubcheck` and I couldn’t upload it to my Kindle.

In this blog post I’ll show you what you should do to generate an Epub that
passes `epubcheck` using Quarto.

## Starting from the default template

Start by installing Quarto by downloading the right package for your operating
system [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). To start from a book template
open a terminal and run:

```
quarto create-project example_book --type book
```

Let’s open the `_quarto.yml` file that is inside the newly created
`example_book/`. This is your book’s configuration file. It should look like
this:

```
project:
  type: book

book:
  title: "example_book"
  author: "Jane Doe"
  date: "3/3/2023"
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - intro.qmd
    - summary.qmd
    - references.qmd

bibliography: references.bib

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrreprt
```

You can change whatever you like, but for our purposes, we are going to add the
`epub` output format all the way at the bottom of the file. So change these
lines:

```
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrreprt
```

into these lines:


```
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  epub:
    toc: true
```

I’ve added the `epub` format as an output, as well as the `toc: true` option,
which builds a table of contents. I’ve also removed the `pdf` output because you
need to have a LaTeX distribution installed for this, and the point of this blog
post is not to talk about the PDF output (which works flawlessly by the way).
Before compiling, let’s open one of the `.qmd` files. These files are the
Markdown source files that we need to edit in order to fill our book with
content. Let’s open `intro.qmd` and change these lines from:

```
# Introduction

This is a book created from markdown and executable code.

See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.
```

to:


```
# Introduction

This is a book created from markdown and executable code.

See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.

```

Download the image from this
[link](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Eyjafjallajokull_Gigjokull_in_ash.jpg/640px-Eyjafjallajokull_Gigjokull_in_ash.jpg?download)
and create the `images/` folder at the root of the book, right next to the
`.qmd` files.

This syntax is the default syntax for adding pictures in a Markdown document. If
you’re an R user, you could also use an R code chunk and the function
`knitr::include_graphics()` to achieve the same thing.

Let’s compile our little example book, and then use `epubcheck` to see what’s
wrong! Use these commands to render the book in all the formats:

```
cd example_book/

quarto render
```

You should see a folder called `_book` appear on the root of your project.
Inside this folder, you will see a bunch of `.html` files: these constitute the
web-site of your book. You can right click on `index.html` and open it with a
web browser and see how your book, as a web-site, looks like. You could host
this book on Github pages for free!

But what interests us is the `.epub` file. If your PDF reader supports this
format, you can open it and see how it looks. On Windows you could use
SumatraPDF. I use Okular on Linux to open PDF and Epub documents. Anyways, there
doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with it. You can open it, you can read it, it
seems to be working just fine. But let’s see if `epubcheck` thinks the same. You
can download `epubcheck` from [here](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epubcheck/).
Save the downloaded file on the root directory of the book and decompress it.
Inside the decompressed folder, you’ll see a file called `epubcheck.jar`. Put
your epub file right next to it, in the same folder. Now, open a terminal and
navigate to the right folder and run the following command to check the epub
file:

```
cd epubcheck-5.0.0 # or whatever version it is you downloaded

java -jar epubcheck.jar example_book.epub
```

You should see this output:

```

Check finished with errors
Messages: 0 fatals / 2 errors / 1 warning / 0 infos

EPUBCheck completed
```

So we get 2 errors and 1 warning! Let’s look at the first error:

```
ERROR(RSC-005): example_book.epub/EPUB/content.opf(6,39): Error while parsing file: character content of element "dc:date" invalid; must 
be a string with length at least 1 (actual length was 0)
```

The first error message states that our epub does not have a valid `dc:date`
attribute. The warning is also related to this. We can correct this by adding
this attribute in the `_quarto.yml` file:

```
format:
  epub:
    toc:
      true
    date:
      "2023-03-01"
```

However this is not enough. There is a bug in the current release of Quarto that
prevents this from working, even though we did what we should. However, this bug
[is already corrected in the development version of the next
release](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4615#issuecomment-1453921865).
But until the next version of Quarto, 1.3, gets released, here is the
workaround; you need to also specify the language of the book:

```
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  epub:
    toc:
      true
    lang:
      en-GB
    date:
      "2023-03-01"
```

And now `epubcheck` does not complain about the date anymore!

The next error:

```
ERROR(RSC-005): example_book.epub/EPUB/text/ch002.xhtml(354,16): Error while parsing file: element "figcaption" not allowed here; expected the element end-tag, text, element "a", "abbr", "area", "audio", "b", "bdi", "bdo", "br", "button", "canvas", "cite", "code", "data", "datalist", "del", "dfn", "em", "embed", "epub:switch", "i", "iframe", "img", "input", "ins", "kbd", "label", "link", "map", "mark", "meta", "meter", "ns1:math", "ns2:svg", "object", "output", "picture", "progress", "q", "ruby", "s", "samp", "script", "select", "small", "span", "strong", "sub", "sup", "template", "textarea", "time", "u", "var", "video" or "wbr" (with xmlns:ns1="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:ns2="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg") or an element from another namespace
```

is related to the image. It turns out that including the image like we did
generates code that is not quite correct from the point of view of the
standard that Epubs should follow. You should know that Epubs are actually a
collection of HTML files, so you can include images by using HTML code in the
source Markdown files.

If you insert the image like so, the error should disappear:

```
<figure>
    <img src="images/640px-Eyjafjallajokull_Gigjokull_in_ash.jpg"
         alt="By Boaworm - Own work, CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=10649477"></img>
    <figcaption>By Boaworm - Own work, CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=10649477</figcaption>
</figure>
```

If you re-render the Epub, and try `epubcheck` again, you should see this:

```
java -jar epubcheck.jar example_book.epub
```

```

No errors or warnings detected.

```

## Using Github Actions to build the book

Finally, as a bonus, if you’re using Github, you can also use Github Actions to
generate the web-site, as well as the Epub (and the PDF if you want). If you go
to [this repository](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/epubcheck_quarto_test),
which contains the example book from this post, you can find the workflow to
automatically build the Epub and web-site from your Quarto source in the
`.github/workflows/` folder. Create the same folder structure in your repository
and copy the `.yml` file that is in it to these folders. You should then create
a `gh-pages` branch and make sure that Github Actions has the required
permissions to push. For this, go to the *Settings* menu of your repository,
then *Actions* (listed in the menu on the left), then *General*, and then under
*Workflow permissions* make sure that *Read and write permissions* is checked.

<div style="text-align:center;">
 <img src="/img/ga_permissions.png" width="100%">
</div>

Now, each time you push, you should see your Epub get built in the `gh-pages`
branch! If you use R code chunks, you also need to set up an action to set up R.
Take a look at the
[repo](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rap4all/blob/master/.github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml)
of my book for an example.
