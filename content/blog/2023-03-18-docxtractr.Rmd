Unfortunately not everyone knows about literate programming so many tables in
Word documents are "generated" by hand (generated is really too strong a word)
and what very often happens is that these handcrafted tables have typos. Usually
it’s totals that are wrong. Checking the totals in these tables by hand with a
pocket calculator is a tedious, long and boring job.

So as my job’s *statistician but also kinda automation dude that types all day
in a weird black box*, I’ve been asked if it were possible to automate these
checks on tables in a Word document. And of course, the answer is yes, because 
whatever you need to get done, there’s an R package for that!

There are, to my knowledge, 2 packages that we can use to get tables from a Word
document into R (an activity that I will now refer to as *office-scraping*).

These packages are `{officer}` and `{docxtractr}`. For his particular task I’ve
used `{docxtractr}`. The reason is that `{docxtractr}` returns the table
"as-is", while `{officer}` returns a tibble where each cell of the table gets a
row in the tibble. `{officer}`'s representation of the scraped tables might be
useful in some cases, but in this particular case, `{docxtractr}`'s approach was
exactly what I needed. 

First of all, we need a Word document with some tables.[Here’s
one](https://github.com/rbind/b-rodrigues.github.com/raw/master/content/blog/report.docx)
I’ve prepared that contains two tables that look close to the ones I had to deal
with. In the actual document, there were hundreds of such tables. Here’s a
picture of the tables in case you can’t open the document:

<div style="text-align:center;">
 <img src="/img/report_tables.png" width="100%">
</div>

The first table is divided by departments of the company, and each section of
the table has its own sub-total. As stated in the beginning, the goal is to
check for typos by recomputing the sub-totals and totals and then comparing
the original tables with the ones where the totals were recomputed.

The problem we will face with each table are the merged cells; if there were
no merged cells, scraping them with `{docxtractr}` would be trivially simple,
but because of these merged cells, we will have to write quite a lot of code
to get them in a format that we can actually use.

## Extracting the tables using {docxtractr}

`{docxtractr}` has a very handy function that gets all the tables from a Word
document and puts them into a list (it’s also possible to extract other stuff
like comments). Let's start by loading `{dplyr}` (for the rest of the functions,
I'll use the `package::function()` notation to make it clear where the functions
come from):

```{r, include = F}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r, eval = F}
library(dplyr)
```

Let's now read the document using `{docxtractr}`:

```{r}
doc_raw <- docxtractr::read_docx("report.docx")
```

And let's get all the tables:

```{r}
list_tables <- docxtractr::docx_extract_all_tbls(doc_raw)
```

Let’s now take a look at the second element of the list, which corresponds to
the second table (I’m starting with the second table because it’s the smallest
of the two):

```{r}
table_1 <- list_tables[[1]] %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

table_2 <- list_tables[[2]] %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

table_2
```

As you can see, because of the merged cells, the rows are not all aligned with
the columns. So we need to split the table, and treat the two parts separately. 
I'm starting with the part of the table where the rows are correctly aligned
with the columns. This is just a matter of renaming some columns, and converting
the numbers (that are represented as characters) into `numeric`s:

```{r}
table_2_1 <- table_2 %>%
  select(-company) %>%
  filter(!is.na(na_7)) %>%
  purrr::set_names(
    c("worker_type",
      "m_2020",
      "f_2020",
      "t_2020",
      "m_2021",
      "f_2021",
      "t_2021",
      "m_2022",
      "f_2022",
      "t_2022"
      )
    ) %>%
  mutate(across(!starts_with("worker"),
                as.numeric))

table_2_1
```

Let’s now deal with the second part of the table. This is the part of the table
where the rows were not aligned with the columns, due to the merged cells.
The operations are essentially the same as before, the difference is that we need
to remove a different column (here we remove `na_7`, before it was `company`):

```{r}
table_2_2 <- table_2 %>%
  filter(is.na(na_7)) %>%
  select(-na_7) %>%
  rename(worker_type = company) %>%
  filter(worker_type != "") %>%
  purrr::set_names(
           c("worker_type",
             "m_2020",
             "f_2020",
             "t_2020",
             "m_2021",
             "f_2021",
             "t_2021",
             "m_2022",
             "f_2022",
             "t_2022"
             )
         ) %>%
  mutate(across(!starts_with("worker"),
                as.numeric))

table_2_2
```

I didn’t comment the operations, but if you’re following along, take some time
to see what each line does.

Now we can bind the rows and we end up with the table from the Word document as
a flat and easy to manipulate data frame:

```{r}
table_2_clean <- bind_rows(
  table_2_1,
  table_2_2
)

table_2_clean
```

All of this because of these merged cells! This may seem like a lot of work, but
imagine that you need to check 50 such tables. You could put all the previous
operations into a function and then simply apply that function over all the
tables (which is exactly what I did at my job). So you end up with 50 cleaned
tables in a matter of seconds. Now let’s not forget our original objective, we
wanted to recompute the totals to check if everything was alright. In the
operations below I remove the columns that represent the totals and remove the
row with the grand totals as well. I then simply recompute the totals:

```{r}
table_2_totals <- table_2_clean %>%
  select(-starts_with("t_")) %>%
  filter(worker_type != "Total") %>%
  mutate(
    t_2020 = m_2020 + f_2020,
    t_2021 = m_2021 + f_2021,
    t_2022 = m_2022 + f_2022,
    ) %>%
  select(
    worker_type,
    m_2020,
    f_2020,
    t_2020,
    m_2021,
    f_2021,
    t_2021,
    m_2022,
    f_2022,
    t_2022,
    ) %>%
  janitor::adorn_totals()

```

We can now compare both data frames and see if there were mistakes:

```{r}
table_2_clean == table_2_totals

```

We do see a bunch of `FALSE` statements, so we need to check those! This is
where some typos where found.

Let’s now deal with table 1. The way we will handle this one will be very
similar to the one before. It's just that we have subtotals to deal with as
well.

```{r}
table_1
```

Here as well, we have a problem with merged cells. But only the rows with the
totals are affected. So just like before, we can split that into two tables and
deal with the two parts separately:

```{r}
table_1_1 <- table_1 %>%
  filter(!grepl("(t|T)otal", by_department),
         fte != "M") %>%
  purrr::set_names(
           c("department",
             "worker_type",
             "m_fte",
             "f_fte",
             "t_fte",
             "m_hc",
             "f_hc",
             "t_hc"
             )
         ) %>%
  mutate(department = ifelse(department == "",
                              NA,
                              department)) %>%
  tidyr::fill(department, .direction = "down") %>%
  mutate(across(contains("fte"),
                \(x)(gsub(pattern = ",", replacement = ".", x = x))),
         across(-c("department", "worker_type"),
                as.numeric)) %>%
  as.data.frame()

```

Here again, it’s really worth it to take your time going through all the
different commands.

Let’s now clean the totals:

```{r}
table_1_2 <- table_1 %>%
  filter(grepl("(t|T)otal", by_department),
         fte != "M") %>%
  select(by_department, na_5, everything()) %>%
  purrr::set_names(
           c("department",
             "worker_type",
             "m_fte",
             "f_fte",
             "t_fte",
             "m_hc",
             "f_hc",
             "t_hc"
             )
         ) %>%
  tidyr::fill(department, .direction = "down") %>%
  mutate(across(-c("department", "worker_type"),
                \(x)(gsub(pattern = ",", replacement = ".", x = x))),
         across(-c("department", "worker_type"),
                as.numeric)) %>%
  as.data.frame()

```

Finally, we can bind the rows and we end up with a clean data frame:

```{r}
table_1 <- bind_rows(
  table_1_1,
  table_1_2
)

table_1
```

Again, let’s not forget our objective: recomputing the totals to see if
everything is alright. So because we need each sub-total, one per department,
we will simply group by departments and use `janitor::adorn_totals()`. But
`janitor::adorn_totals()` does not work on grouped data frames. So instead
I use `group_nest()` to create a tibble with a list column, and then map
`janitor::adorn_totals`:

```{r}
table_1_subtotals <- table_1 %>%
  filter(!grepl("(t|T)otal", department)) %>%
  group_nest(department) %>%
  mutate(data = purrr::map(data, janitor::adorn_totals)) %>%
  tidyr::unnest(cols = data) %>%
  arrange(department) %>%
  as.data.frame()
```

Ok so in the table above I have the subtotals per department. Now, I need to
compute the grand total:

```{r}
table_1_total <- table_1_subtotals %>%
  filter(grepl("Total", worker_type)) %>%
  janitor::adorn_totals()

```

Now I just need to bind the grand total to the table from before:

```{r}
table_1_clean <- bind_rows(
  table_1_subtotals,
  filter(
    table_1_total,
    department == "Total")
)

table_1_clean
```

We're almost done! We now need to make sure that the rows are in the same
order across the two tables. So we need to transform the original table from
the Word document a little bit:

```{r}
table_1 <- table_1 %>%
  mutate(worker_type = ifelse(is.na(worker_type),
                              "Total",
                              worker_type)) %>%
  mutate(department = stringr::str_remove_all(department, "Total – "),
         worker_type = ifelse(department == "Grand total",
                              "-",
                              worker_type),
         department = ifelse(department == "Grand total",
                             "Total",
                             department))
```

We can now order them the same way, and finally compare them!

```{r}
arrange(table_1, worker_type) == arrange(table_1_clean, worker_type)
```

Let's see where all the `FALSE`s are:

```{r}
arrange(table_1, worker_type)
```

We see that the totals for department A and F are all wrong, and some others for
other departments as well. Obviously the grand total is this completely wrong!

## Conclusion

If this looked complicated, let me assure you that, yes, it was. That's quite
typical with tasks like these: if the data is not in a tidy format, you really
have to type a lot of code to make it tidy. But the advantage now is that I
could put all this code into two functions, and apply them to as many tables as
I need. This is what I did, and what I will be doing in the future as well.
Now that the code is written, I can simply keep applying it to future reports
that use the same table format.
