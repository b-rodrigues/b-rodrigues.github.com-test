I've tweeted this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just changed like 100 grepl calls to stringi::stri_detect and my pipeline now runs 4 times faster <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RStats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RStats</a></p>&mdash; Bruno Rodrigues (@brodriguesco) <a href="https://twitter.com/brodriguesco/status/1549659454483857409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

much discussed ensued. Some people were surprised, because in their experience, `grepl()`
was faster than alternatives, especially if you set the `perl` parameter in `grepl()` to  `TRUE`.
My use case was quite simple; I have a relatively large data set (half a million lines) with
one column with several misspelling of city names. So I painstakingly wrote some code
to correct the spelling of the major cities (those that came up often enough to matter. Minor
cities were set to "Other". Sorry, [Wiltz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiltz)!)

So in this short blog post, I benchmark some code to see if what I did the other day was a fluke.
Maybe something weird with my R installation on my work laptop running Windows 10 somehow
made `stri_detect()` run faster than `grepl()`? I don't even know if something like that is 
possible. I'm writing these lines on my Linux machine, unlike the code I run at work.
So maybe if I find some differences, they could be due to the different OS running. 
I don't want to have to deal with Windows on my days off (for my blood pressure's sake), 
so I'm not running this benchmark on my work laptop. So that part we'll never know.

Anyways, let's start by getting some data. I'm not commenting the code below, because that's not
the point of this post.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(stringi)
library(stringr)
library(re2)

adult <- vroom::vroom(
  "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data"
)

adult_colnames <- readLines(
  "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.names"
)

adult_colnames <- adult_colnames[97:110] %>%
  str_extract(".*(?=:)") %>%
  str_replace_all("-", "_")

adult_colnames <- c(adult_colnames, "wage")

colnames(adult) <- adult_colnames

adult
```

Let's now write the functions used for benchmarking. There will be 5 of them:

- One using `grepl()` without any fancy options;
- One using `grepl()` where `perl` is set to `TRUE`;
- One that uses `stringi::stri_detect()`;
- One that uses `stringr::str_detect()`;
- One that uses `re2::re2_detect()`.

Below you can read the functions. They're all pretty much the same, only the function 
looking for the string changes. These functions look for a string in the `marital_status` 
variable and create a new variable with a corresponding integer.

```{r}
with_grepl <- function(dataset){
  dataset |>
    mutate(married = case_when(
             grepl("Married", marital_status) ~ 1,
             grepl("married", marital_status) ~ 2,
             TRUE ~ 3)
           )
}

with_grepl_perl <- function(dataset){
  dataset |>
    mutate(married = case_when(
             grepl("Married", marital_status, perl = TRUE) ~ 1,
             grepl("married", marital_status, perl = TRUE) ~ 2,
             TRUE ~ 3)
           )
}

with_stringi <- function(dataset){
  dataset |>
    mutate(married = case_when(
             stri_detect(marital_status, regex = "Married") ~ 1,
             stri_detect(marital_status, regex = "married") ~ 2,
             TRUE ~ 3)
           )
}

with_stringr <- function(dataset){
  dataset |>
    mutate(married = case_when(
             str_detect(marital_status, "Married") ~ 1,
             str_detect(marital_status, "married") ~ 2,
             TRUE ~ 3)
           )
}

with_re2 <- function(dataset){
  dataset |>
    mutate(married = case_when(
             re2_detect(marital_status, "Married") ~ 1,
             re2_detect(marital_status, "married") ~ 2,
             TRUE ~ 3)
           )
}
```

Now I make extra sure these functions actually return the exact same thing. So for this
I'm running them once on the data and use `testthat::expect_equal()`. It's a bit 
unwieldy, so if you have a better way of doing this, please let me know.

```{r}
run_grepl <- function(){
  with_grepl(adult) %>%
    count(married, marital_status)
}

one <- run_grepl()

run_grepl_perl <- function(){
  with_grepl_perl(adult) %>%
    count(married, marital_status)
}

two <- run_grepl_perl()

run_stringi <- function(){
  with_stringi(adult) %>%
    count(married, marital_status)
}

three <- run_stringi()

run_stringr <- function(){
  with_stringr(adult) %>%
    count(married, marital_status)
}

four <- run_stringr()

run_re2 <- function(){
  with_re2(adult) %>%
    count(married, marital_status)
}

five <- run_re2()

one_eq_two <- testthat::expect_equal(one, two)
one_eq_three <- testthat::expect_equal(one, three)
three_eq_four <- testthat::expect_equal(three, four)

testthat::expect_equal(
            one_eq_two,
            one_eq_three
          )

testthat::expect_equal(
            one_eq_three,
            three_eq_four
          )

testthat::expect_equal(
            one,
            five)
```

`testthat::expect_equal()` does not complain, so I'm pretty sure my functions, while different,
return the exact same thing. Now, we're ready for the benchmark itself. Let's run these 
function 500 times using `{microbenchmark}`:

```{r}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
     run_grepl(),
     run_grepl_perl(),
     run_stringi(),
     run_stringr(),
     run_re2(),
     times = 500
)

```

There you have it folks! The winner is `grepl()` with `perl = TRUE`, and then it's 
pretty much tied between `stringi()`, `stringr()` and `re2()` (maybe there's a slight edge
for `re2()`) and `grepl()` with `perl = TRUE` is last. But don't forget that this is running
on my machine with Linux installed on it; maybe you'll get different results on different
hardware and OSs! So if you rely a lot on `grepl()` and other such string manipulation
function, maybe run a benchmark on your hardware first. How come switching from `grepl()`
(without `perl = TRUE` though) to `stri_detect()` made my pipeline at work run 4 times
faster I don't know. Maybe it has also to do with the size of the data, and the complexity
of the regular expression used to detect the problematic strings?
