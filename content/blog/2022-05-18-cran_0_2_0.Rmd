I am very happy to annouce that the `{chronicler}` package, which I’ve been working on for the past
3 months has been released on CRAN. Install it with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("chronicler")
```

`{chronicler}` allows you to create objects that carry a log
with them. Here is an example of an object that has been created using `{chronicler}`, and saved
using `saveRDS()` (which we now load back into our session using `readRDS()`):

```{r, include = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(
  library(dplyr)
)

library(chronicler)

r_group_by <- record(group_by)
r_select <- record(select)
r_summarise <- record(summarise)
r_filter <- record(filter)

my_df <- starwars %>%
  r_select(height, mass, species, sex) %>%
  bind_record(r_group_by, species, sex) %>%
  bind_record(r_filter, sex != "male") %>%
  bind_record(r_summarise,
              mass = mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE)
              )

```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(chronicler)

my_df <- readRDS("path/to/my_df.rds")
```

Printing `my_df` shows the following output:

```{r}
my_df
```

`my_df` is made up of two parts, one is a data set, and the other is the log. If you wish
to know how this data set was created, you can call `read_log(my_df)` (this function will
be renamed to `read.log()` in the next release, to avoid clashing with `readr::read_log()`):

```{r}
read_log(my_df)
```

if you want to get the dataset out of the `{chronicler}` "box", you can do so with `pick(my_df, "value")`:

```{r}
pick(my_df, "value")
```

To know more about all the package has to offer, read the
[readme](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/chronicler/) and the
[vignettes](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/chronicler/articles/) on the package’s website. I’m
already working on the next release, where I plan to add the following features:

* Rename `read_log()` to `read.log()`
* Make `{chronicler}` work with `{ggplot2}` (as described [here](https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2022-05-15-self_doc_ggplot/))
* Introduce functions to save `{chronicler}` objects as `.csv` or `.xlsx` files to disk (if the underlying value is a `data.frame`, as in the example above)
* Anything else I think of between now and then!

I’m really looking forward to see how people are going to use this package for their work,
personally I’ve been mixing `{chronicler}` with `{targets}` to build very robust pipelines to build
`chronicle` objects!

## Thanks
