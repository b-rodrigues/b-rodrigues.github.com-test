I have this hypothesis that packages that introduce a unique syntax, or a workflow change,
get adopted less by users, even if what these packages do is super useful.
I'm going to discuss two examples of packages that I think are really, really useful, but sometimes
I wonder how many R users use them, or would use them if they were aware these packages existed.
I myself, only use one of them!

The first package is [`{typed}`](https://github.com/moodymudskipper/typed) which introduces a type 
system for R. No more silent conversion to and from types without your knowing! If you don't
know what a type system is, consider the following:

```{r}
nchar("100000000")
```

you get "9" back, no problem. But if you do:

```{r}
nchar(100000000)
```

You get 5 back... what in the Lord's name happened here? What happened is that the number 100000000 could
converted to a character implicitly. But because of all these 0's, this is what happened:

```{r}
as.character(100000000)
```

It gets converted to a character alright, but scientific notation gets used! So yes, 
`r as.character(100000000)` is 5 characters long... Ideally `nchar()` would at least warn you that
this conversion is happening, or maybe even error. After all, it’s called `nchar()` not `nnumeric()` or
whatever. (Thanks to
[`@cararthompson`](https://twitter.com/cararthompson/status/1525114767614087169?s=20&t=oEOD1Vf7q9l0ZpdVLyDeUw)
for this!)

A solution could be to write a wrapper around it:

```{r}
nchar2 <- function(x, ...){
  stopifnot("x is not a character" = is.character(x))

  nchar(x, ...)
}
```

Now this function is safe:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nchar2(123456789)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## [1] Error in nchar2(123456789) : x is not a character
```

`{typed}` makes writing safe functions like this easier.
Using `{typed}` you can write the wrapper like this:

```{r}
library(typed)

strict_nchar <- ? function(x = ? Character(), ...){

  nchar(x, ...)

}
```

`{typed}` introduces `?` (masking the base `?` function to read a function docs) allowing you
to set the type the functions arguments. It's also possible to set the return type of the function:

```{r}
strict_nchar <- Integer() ? function(x = ? Character(), ...){

  nchar(x, ...)

}

```

```{r}
strict_nchar("10000000")
```

The second kind of package I was thinking about are packages like `{targets}`, which force users to
structure their projects in a very specific way. I really like `{targets}` and have been using it for quite
some time. `{targets}` takes inspiration from build automation tools from the software development world
and introduces the concept of build automation in R. If you’re a linux user, you’ve probably dealt with
`Makefile`s (especially if you’ve been using linux for more than 10 years), and `{targets}` is works in
a similar way; by writing a script in which you define *targets*, these get built in a reproducible way.
If you’d like to see it in action, take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvJ4xRGiEgw)
of mine.

Now here’s the meat of the post: I think that packages like these, even though they’re very useful,
get adopted less by users than other very useful packages, that either:

  - do not introduce a unique way of doing things;
- for which alternatives are available.

Take `{dplyr}` for instance. One could argue that it introduces both a unique syntax, and a very specific
workflow:

```{r}

mtcars %>%
 filter(am == 0) %>%
 group_by(cyl) %>%
 summarise(mean_hp = mean(hp))

```
